# TidyWorld: Agentic Self-Maintaining Knowledge Graph

> **‚ö†Ô∏è WORK IN PROGRESS**: This project is under active development and the features described may not be fully implemented yet.

TidyWorld reimagines knowledge graph construction by creating a dynamic, intelligent system that automatically evolves its understanding of data through agentic processes. Unlike traditional knowledge graphs that require manual schema definition and static extraction rules, TidyWorld uses AI agents to continuously learn, adapt, and maintain both the data structure and content quality.

## üåü Project Vision

### Core Philosophy
TidyWorld addresses fundamental limitations in current knowledge graph systems:
- **Structured Extraction** Unstructured extraction leads to enourmous duplication and reduces usability.
- **Queryability** Voluminous textual data can be quried fast and easyG
- **Knowledge Updation and Provenance** Keep each peice of information trackable to the document and its metadata.
- **Flexible** Add business logic to extraction/updation
- **Linkages** Different graph entities can be linked to a diverse range of data storages.

### Key Innovations

#### 1. **Agentic Schema Evolution**
Instead of manually defining rigid schemas, TidyWorld uses AI agents to:
- Automatically discover entity types and their properties from documents
- Evolve schemas as new information patterns emerge
- Maintain backward compatibility while adding new fields and relationships
- Use semantic field matching to intelligently assign extracted data to appropriate schemas

#### 2. **Factoid-Based Versioning System**
TidyWorld stores information as atomic, versioned factoids that preserve:
- **Complete change history** - Track how entity attributes evolve over time
- **Source attribution** - Link every piece of information to its originating document
- **Conflict resolution** - Handle contradictory information from multiple sources
- **Temporal queries** - Reconstruct entity states at any point in time

#### 3. **Intelligent Deduplication with Separate Processing Paths**
The system routes extracted entities through specialized agentic paths:
- **Creation Path**: For genuinely new entities requiring fresh graph nodes
- **Update Path**: For adding information to existing entities
- **Merge Path**: For combining duplicate entities discovered across documents
- **Conflict Path**: For handling uncertain cases that need human review or additional analysis

#### 4. **Hybrid Storage Architecture**
TidyWorld coordinates between multiple storage systems:
- **NoSQL Database**: Stores versioned factoids with complete audit trails
- **Knowledge Graph**: Maintains current canonical entity views and relationships
- **Vector Database**: Enables semantic search and schema matching
- **Event-Driven Sync**: Ensures consistency across all storage layers

### Hybrid storage manager


### Storages

#### VectorDB storage
- Create collection
- Delete collection
- Create Item

#### NoSQLDB storage

#### Graph storage

### Key Technical Decisions

#### **Why Factoids Over Traditional Entity Storage?**
- **Granular Provenance**: Know exactly which document contributed each piece of information
- **Conflict Management**: Handle contradictory information without data loss
- **Temporal Analysis**: Track how entity attributes change over time
- **Source Quality**: Weight information based on document reliability and recency

#### **Why Hybrid Schema Approach?**
- **Human Accessibility**: YAML files enable non-technical schema editing
- **Runtime Performance**: Database storage provides millisecond schema lookups
- **Semantic Intelligence**: Vector embeddings enable smart schema selection
- **Version Control**: Git integration for schema change management

#### **Why Separate Processing Paths?**
- **Specialized Logic**: Different algorithms for creation vs. updates vs. merges
- **Performance Optimization**: Avoid expensive deduplication for clearly new entities
- **Quality Control**: Route uncertain cases to human reviewers
- **Scalability**: Parallel processing of different entity types

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Supported vector database (Qdrant, Weaviate, or Chroma)
- NoSQL database (MongoDB, ArangoDB, or Cassandra)
- Knowledge graph database (Neo4j, ArangoDB, or NetworkX)

### Basic Usage
```python
from tidyworld import TidyWorld

# Initialize with your preferred storage backends
tidy = TidyWorld(
    working_dir="./knowledge_graph",
    vector_storage="qdrant://localhost:6333",
    nosql_storage="mongodb://localhost:27017/tidyworld",
    graph_storage="neo4j://localhost:7687"
)

# Ingest documents - schemas evolve automatically
await tidy.insert([
    "John Doe works at Microsoft as a Senior Engineer.",
    "Jane Smith is the CEO of TechCorp, located in San Francisco."
])

# Query with full provenance
result = await tidy.query(
    "Who works at technology companies?",
    include_provenance=True,
    temporal_context="last_6_months"
)
```

### Model Configuration
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from tidyworld._types import TSchemaSource, TSchemaDefinition

# Define a schema source
source = TSchemaSource(
    name="user_models",
    source_type="json",
    location="/path/to/models.json",
    metadata={"version": "1.0"}
)

# Define a model with identifiers
class Person(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., identifier=True)
    email: str = Field(..., identifier=True)
    age: int | None = None
    occupation: str | None = None

# Create schema definition
person_schema = TSchemaDefinition(
    model_name="Person",
    schema_definition={
        "name": {"type": "string"},
        "email": {"type": "string", "format": "email"},
        "age": {"type": "integer", "optional": True},
        "occupation": {"type": "string", "optional": True}

        "version": "1.0",
        "category": "user",
        "description": "Person entity with professional attributes"
    }
)
```
